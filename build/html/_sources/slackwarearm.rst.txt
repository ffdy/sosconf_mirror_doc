Introduction
============
Slackware is one of the Grandfathers of the Linux/Open Source ecosystem and is one of the oldest distributions that is actively developed. It's a unique distribution in many ways: Slackware presents a modern Linux/GNU software package set, yet retains its heritage of a classic Unix-style Operating System environment.

The distribution itself is easy to understand, as the entire OS management suite and boot process is written in Unix shell code with good inline documentation. This also is a testament to the power of the Unix shell!

It's rare in the Open Source ecosystem to have the entire OS design and development be chiefly the work of an individual - the project's creator, Patrick Volkerding. This provides a level of consistency and stability in the user experience that is not seen in other distributions, and means that there are no politics involved (which is great for Slackers!).

Slackware ARM began in 2002 by Stuart Winter - Slackware's ARM Platform Architect and Developer - and was given the name "ARMedslack". The name was later changed to "Slackware ARM / AArch64" when the project became the official port for the ARM platform.
