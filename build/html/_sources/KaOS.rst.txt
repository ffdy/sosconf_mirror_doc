Introduction
============

KaOS is a desktop Linux distribution featuring the latest version of the KDE desktop environment and other popular software programs using the Qt toolkit.

It was originally based on Arch Linux, but since April 2013, developers started creating their own packages, which are now available from KaOS's own repositories. KaOS adopts a rolling release development model and is only available for 64-bit computer systems.
